# nodes in the AST that describe the grammar.  all Matcher instacnes must be
# mutable and have an attribute
#  name::Symbol
# which is set automatically to the matcher type by the constructor.

# used to configure the parser.  all Config subtypes must have associated
# dispatch functions (see parser.jl), a parent() function, and have a
# constructor that takes the source as first argument and additional arguments
# as keywords.  the type of the source is exposed and if it's a subclass of
# string then the iterator is assumed to be a simple integer index.

# important notes on mutability / hash / equality

# 1 - struct types in julia are not "just" struct.  they are
# effectively values - they are passed by value.  so do not use
# "struct" just because the data should not change.  think about
# details.

# 2 - struct types have an automatic equality and hash based on
# content (which is copied).  mutable types have an automatic equality
# and hash based on address.  so default hash and equality for
# struct types that contain mutable types, and for mutable types,
# may not be what is required.

# 3 - caching within the parser REQUIRES that bpth Matcher and State
# instances have 'useful' equality and hash values.

# 4 - for matchers, which are created when the grammar is defined, and
# then unchanged, the default hash and equality are likely just fine,
# even for mutable objects (in fact, mutable may be slightly faster
# since equality is just a comparison of an Int64 address,
# presumably).

# 5 - for states, which often includes mutable result objects, more
# care is needed:

# 5a - whether or not State instances are mutable or struct, they,
# and their contents, must not change during matching.  so all arrays,
# for example, must be copied when new instances are created with
# different values.

# 5b - structurally identical states must be equal, and hash equally.
# this is critical for efficienct caching.  so it it likely that
# custom hash and equality methods will be needed (see above and
# auto.jl).

# parent and parent_state are popped from the stack.  a call is made to
# success(config, parent, parent_state, child_state, iter, result)

# failure(config, parent, parent_state)

# execute(config, child, child_state, iter)

    parent_state::State  # stored by trampoline, added to response
